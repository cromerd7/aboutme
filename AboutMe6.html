 <p style= "background: yellow; width: 7%">What I want to learn?</p>

 <p>My background is in Art, also I have a love for technology. Therefore, I combined the two and decided to major in Web Design at CCC.</br>I am learning so much!</br>
I hope to learn a lot more about the programming and development side of Web design in this course! I hope to use everything I learn in my future</br>career in Web design and development.</p>
